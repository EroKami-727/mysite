            Pass overhead
            I've forgotten what's it like
            To feel weightlessness, my strings untied
            My arms are long
            Strong enough for flight
            But can they push away this heavy silence?
            But maybe if you're tongue-tied I could walk you through it all
            Find you in the lowlight
            Fight your battles through this war
            Broken on my doorstep
            You were falling through the seams
            Breaking every finger
            Thinking it would make you clean


            And I know
            In the far light
            In the lightning
            There are pieces of myself
            You're setting off
            You're setting off
            And I'm frail
            And I'm poured out
            But I told you
            There are parts you'll never see
            And they're aligning in the stars
            (The stars, the stars, the stars, the stars)

            Pass over my head
            With your wings extended wide
            I can taste the way you terrify me
            Grow towards the sun
            Leave me far behind
            'Til you extend into this pale horizon


            But maybe if I'm tongue-tied you could walk me through it all
            Find me in the low light, let your body break my walls
            I'll be on your doorstep sorting through my empty dreams
            Breaking every finger praying that it makes me clean
            And I know
            In the far light
            In the lightning
            There are pieces of myself
            You're setting off
            You're setting off
            And I'm frail
            And I'm poured out
            But I told you
            There are parts you'll never see
            They're all aligning in the stars
            (The stars, the stars, the stars, the stars)


            Maybe if you take time, we could still escape this place
            Our pearly gates are burning and yet somehow fire feels so safe
            If I told you "Jump now", would you let it all erase?
            Join me in the far light, blooming in a fiery blaze
